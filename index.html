        <h2>My name is Blessing Ukanah and this is why i love <i>Technology</i>...</h2>
        <p><b>Technology is literally the future!</b>
            <i>it keeps getting better and better.
             New inventions everyday, making 
             room for more opportunities especially 
             in the job market. What's not to love about tech? 
            Technology makes life easy and is the reason we can
             communicate with the world. My favorite thing
              about all of these is that the skills are
               transferrable and will continue to be valuable.</i>

<h2> Importance of css</h2>
<p>The importance of <b>css</b> cannot be over emphasized,
    As it the visual power of the web. 
    css helps to beautify our web pages..
    it enables us style our web pages to our taste.
    <i>Without css our web pages will be displayed 
    plainly and without style.</i> </p>
